# lifemon

lifemon is a life monitoring tool built to further prove that I know how to use React and Bootstrap. Development began October 28, 2020.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Plans
  - Set "for today" to-do lists and long-term lists with due dates. Each day, it pulls up the previous day's list and allows you to update the list or carry items from yesterday into today.
- [ ] Journal
  - Write about your day overall or in chunks based on a particular time. Tracks the weather at the current time/day and (optionally) location.
- [ ] Mood
  - Specify and track your mood throughout the day with an optional journal entry about what you were doing. Use emojis for mood icons and keep track of recently-used moods for easy re-selection.
- [ ] Time
  - A simple customizable timer for either practicing the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) or doing simple countdowns and alarms.
- [ ] Log
  - An at-a-glance listing of previous entries that displays date, number of entries, moods, etc. Can be clicked to show a modal popup with more detail or expanded to show the full day's details.

This seems like a pretty decent collection of features to start out with. If I think of more that I like, I'll update this list.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
